## Deployments

### Master (CI)

- the UI is built and copied to S3;
- the API is built, published to docker hub and deployed to the dev and reviews environments.

This is handled in .github/workflows/ci.yml

### Reviews (CI)

- the UI is build and copied to S3;
- the UI uses the existing "dev" api.

This is handled in .github/workflows/ci.yml

### Int (manual)

#### Creation of a new release
- a version is chosen (the sprint number + some patch increment);
- the UI is built and copied to S3 on releases/$VERSION;
- the API is built, published to docker hub with the swissgeol_api:$VERSION tag.

```bash
export VERSION="" # the version (like 2022.02.0)
git checkout $VERSION
cd ui; scripts/release_ui.sh; cd -
cd api; scripts/release_api.sh; cd -
```

#### Deployment of a new version

- the UI is copied from S3 releases/$VERSION to int;
- the ngm_api:int tag is set and pushed to docker hub;
- fargate is redeployed on int.

```bash
export VERSION="" # the version (like 2022.02.0)
git checkout $VERSION
scripts/deploy_viewer.sh int
```

### Prod-viewer (manual)

The version should have been created and tested on int first.

```bash
export VERSION="" # the version (like 2022.02.0)
git checkout $VERSION
scripts/deploy_viewer.sh prod
```
